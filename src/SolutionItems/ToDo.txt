- add to base test to retrieve log & exception

- add monitor event when user pause / delete / add job / invoke job / cancel job / join to cluster / remove from cluster / start scheduler / stop scheduler
- add interface to hooks to handle system events
- job test: in no instance id, check hc and print warning about already running job with no concurent

- *** stop service while long running task (service provider is null) ***
      * Error handle SafeScan: BaseListener.cs:line 28
      * Error handle LogJobListener.JobWasExecuted: BaseListener.cs:line 48
      * system jobs
- *** implement GetPausedTriggerGroups
- *** validate new or update job without triggers is must be durable
- *** cli may CRUD trigger data
- *** cli test: job that finish very fast - the test dont found it in running jobs. it should search in history
- *** cli connect with option to remember
- *** cli show triggers menu on '?' argument

- *** bug: use ? in cli at trigger id but show job menu. maybe show second menu of triggers list ***
- api to get demo yml file 
- cli test cluster command
- option to pause job after {x} fails in row
- add service to convert cron to readable text https://github.com/bradymholt/cron-expression-descriptor
- add auto complete to cli (https://github.com/rohankapoor/AutoPrompt, )

-----------------------------------------DONE-----------------------------------------
- run database migration on each startup
- cli health check should check cluster mode
- allow to stop planar scheduler without stop the windows service (service stop, service start, service shutdown)
- add cluster support in cli in all "running" commands (and stop)
- filter /swagger from trace
- enrich serilog with machine name
- filter /Cluster.PlanarCluster/HealthCheck from trace
- when delete job --> delete its monitoring items
- add monitor event when retry
- add concurent property to yml
- move to .net 6
- planar stop with job id (not only instance id)
- when cli has no connection to service - show specific error

- check how cli display interval of trigger that is morre the 24 hours
- cli monitor add will not start if no hooks exists
- dont allow to delete group when the group has monitoring
- ERROR!!! job running pguegs0udxg
- allow job running with quiet mode
- enforce required parameters on cli
- call cluster functions only if running is cluster mode
- misfire behaviour should be enum in yml file
-- job runningdata w10n-TsahiAti637964208165023851637964208471912498 should return 404
- trigger get -> show misfirebehaviour as numeric
- job settings <id> return empty
- job add with only folder name
- persistance system job write also the duration
- cli: job invoke show list of abc jobs
- cli: job invoke !! invoke the last running job
- cli: job test !! test the last running job
