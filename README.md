### Get Started

You can host and manage Planar directly on your pc by using Docker.

Docker is an open source [containerization](https://www.ibm.com/in-en/cloud/learn/containerization) platform. It enables developers to package applications into standardized executable components called containers

1. Create an installation folder called `Planar` for deployment and data storage.
2. `cd` into the installation folder.
3. Download the [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/atias007/Planar/releases/download/version_1.2.0/docker-compose.yml) file and place it into the `Planar` installation folder.
4. Start the Docker container by running the command below.[^1][^2]
 
   `docker-compose -p planar up -d`

   [^1]: This may need to be run with sudo if docker and docker-compose aren't accessible by the user. 
   [^2]: If the image doesn't exist locally, this command downloads the necessary Docker image and starts the container.
